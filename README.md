# Project 1: The Ultimate Tic Tac Toe Game.

Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe is a strategy game played on a 3x3 grid of Tic-Tac-Toe boards. Players take turns playing on the smaller boards, aiming to win individual boards to dominate the main 3x3 grid. The winner of the game is the first player to win three sub-games in a row on the main board.
